## What is Codenames?

Codenames is a 2015 card game for 4–8 players designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games Edition. Two teams compete by each having a "spymaster" give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. The other players on the team attempt to guess their team's words while avoiding the words of the other team. In a variant with 2–3 players, one spymaster gives clues to the other player or players.

## Getting Started

### Client

You need 2 terminal windows. One for Create React App and one for ReasonML:

Inside the `client` folder, install the dependencies `yarn` and then `yarn start` to start the server.
In another terminal window, run: `yarn re:watch` to start the reason compiler

### Server

Same idea. Two terminal windows:

Inside the `client` folder, install the dependencies `yarn` and then `yarn start` to start the server.
In another terminal window, run: `yarn re:watch` to start the reason compiler
